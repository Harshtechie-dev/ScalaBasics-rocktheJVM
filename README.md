# My Scala at Light Speed Journey 🚀

This repository captures my initial learning and code explorations from **Rock the JVM's "Scala at Light Speed"** mini course. As someone just starting to dive into Scala (thanks to my manager's encouragement!), this repo is my personal sandbox.

Feel free to browse, learn alongside me, or even suggest ways to improve my beginner-level code!
